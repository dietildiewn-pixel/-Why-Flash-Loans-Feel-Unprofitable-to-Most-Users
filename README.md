## Market Reality

Flash loan environments are dominated by:

- Automated bots
- MEV strategies
- Professional developers

Humans compete at a disadvantage.

---

## Execution Challenges

- Slippage
- Gas volatility
- Front-running
- Liquidity shifts

Any failure cancels the transaction.

---

## Capital Reset Problem

Flash loans do not provide persistent capital.

Every strategy begins from zero.

No accumulation is possible.

---

## Broader Context

Crypto loans extend duration but require excess collateral.

Both models exclude average participants.

---

## Crypto-Native Capital Access

Capital access systems seek to:

- Remove coding barriers
- Enable longer execution windows
- Allocate funds based on strategy design
